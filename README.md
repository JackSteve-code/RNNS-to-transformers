## Objective:
To provide a rigorous architectural reference for the shift from Recurrent Neural Networks to Attention-based models.

## Technical Highlights:

The Vanishing Gradient Problem: Mathematical analysis of the Jacobian of hidden-state transitions in vanilla RNNs.Gating Mechanisms: Additive state updates in LSTMs (the "constant error carousel") vs. simplified GRU architectures.Self-Attention & Parallelization: Elimination of sequential dependencies through the Transformer's $Attention(Q,K,V)$ mechanism.Scaling Laws: Analysis of empirical performance gains in modern LLMs through compute and data scaling.
